<p>
	I’m a <a href="https://github.com/RVMendoza">front-end web developer</a> and Detroit, Michigan is my home.
</p>

<p>
	HTML, CSS, and javascript are a given, but <a href="http://vimeo.com/68470326" target="_blank">doing the right thing</a> is what I care about the most.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/romualdvictor/fightfortheuser">Fighting for the user</a> is something I seem to have endless energy for.  
</p>
<!-- Yeah, that's right, I just ended a sentence with a preposition. SO WHAT. The correct way didn't sound human.-->

<p>
	I believe that making a web app mobile-first, responsive, and accessible is not just good practice, but an opportunity to increase our capacity for compassion.
</p>

<p>
	I’m currently a front-end developer on a team that paves the road for our clients to <a href="http://myql.com/" target="_blank">pay off their debt</a>.
</p>

<p>
	In everything I do, my desire is to stir people towards bravery, courage, and transparency.  
	I’m currently going through a journey with <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/0YVK604Puec6VbHp2x59Il?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open">my music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvsTrtByXee-n5B5hPPkixqakTTax3Bb1" target="_blank">my health</a>–and it feels great to be <a href="http://www.patreon.com/rvmendoza" target="_blank">supported</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I’m also very proud to be part of a <a href="http://instagram.com/woodsideDetroit" target="_blank">vibrant collective</a> that truly cares for the city and has a genuine heart for those in need. 
</p>

<p>
	My growth depends on being around <a href="{{ site.url }}/smarter-than-me.html">people that are smarter than me</a>, 
	so let's connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/RVxMendoza">Twitter</a> 
	and <a href="https://instagram.com/RVxMendoza">Instagram</a>!</p>
