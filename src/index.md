I’m a <a href="https://github.com/RVMendoza" target="_blank">front-end web developer</a> and Detroit, Michigan is my home.

HTML, CSS, and javascript are a given, but <a href="http://vimeo.com/68470326" target="_blank">doing the right thing</a> is what I care about the most.

<a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/romualdvictor/fightfortheuser" target="_blank">Fighting for the user</a> is something I seem to have endless energy for.  
<!-- Yeah, that's right, I just ended a sentence with a preposition. SO WHAT. The correct way didn't sound human.-->

I believe that making a web app mobile-first, responsive, and accessible is not just good practice, but an opportunity to increase our capacity for compassion.

I’m currently a UI/UX engineer on a team that <a href="http://www.leveleleven.com" target="_blank">helps you, be a better you</a>.

Before that, I was creating responsive web apps that paved the road for clients to <a href="http://myql.com/" target="_blank">pay off their debt</a>.

In everything I do, my desire is to stir people towards bravery, courage, and transparency.  
I’m currently going through a journey with <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/0YVK604Puec6VbHp2x59Il?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open" target="_blank">my music</a> and <a href="https://www.VeganInDetroit.com" target="_blank">my health</a>–and it feels great to be <a href="http://www.patreon.com/rvmendoza" target="_blank">supported</a>.

I’m also very proud to be part of a <a href="http://instagram.com/woodsideDetroit" target="_blank">vibrant collective</a> that truly cares for the city and has a genuine heart for those in need. 

My growth depends on being around <a href="{{ site.url }}/smarter-than-me.html" target="_blank">people that are smarter than me</a>,
