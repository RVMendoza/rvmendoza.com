title: People Smarter Than Me

---
<p>
	I live within the tension where my taste, is better than my abilities. 
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://vimeo.com/24715531">Closing that gap</a> will come with age and experience, but I pray that it will never be the opposite.</p>
</p>

<p>
	To bridge that gap, I seek out environments where I'm surrounded by people that are smarter than me.  
	I have gained so much knowledge and wisdom from the likes of 
	<a href="https://twitter.com/vinspee">Vince Speelman</a>, 
	<a href="https://twitter.com/yodasw16">Dave Gillhespy</a>, 
	<a href="https://twitter.com/hudsonperalta">Ryan Hudson-Peralta</a> and Steve Kluck.  
	They have been essential to my growth as a developer and as a person.
