Topsoil is inside of the MOCAD (Museum of Contemporary Art), and it's presented by Russel Street Deli.

Everything there is vegan, but if you want, you can request eggs on some dishes.

A notable thing is that they have vegan CONEY DOGS. A great treat for the vegan that dreams of a vegan hotdog.

Their website says they have a full beer and win menu as well as coffee and tea selections!

Everything is really affordable, and they try to make everything under $7.
